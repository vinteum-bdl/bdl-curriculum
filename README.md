# Bitcoin Dev Launchpad by Vinteum

Developing a traditional career in software development is the natural path for
most programmers. Yet, we interact with many talented people who we belive could
be developing self-driven open source careers. Our growing community of
Brazilian Bitcoin developers makes us believe there are many more gifted
Brazilian and other Portuguese-speakers devs who could contribute to
critical projects while developing more fulfilling careers.

The Bitcoin Dev Launchpad (BDL) program is a 40-week program with the goal to
provide a solid foundation about the Bitcoin protocol and FOSS development to
the participants. With BDL, we want to identify talented programmers, improve
their Bitcoin protocol knowledge and skills, and provide the means to help them
turn into full-time open source contributors. The Bitcoin Dev Launchpad is built
upon the [Chaincode Labs'](https://learning.chaincode.com), [BTrust
Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders), and
[B4OS](https://www.libreriadesatoshi.com/b4os) programmes, adding to the global
educational Bitcoin landscape.
